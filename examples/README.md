# Stickopy ─ other examples

This folder contains some other “versions” of *Stickopy*, which perform various actions.  
These “versions” nevertheless have some parameters to change, and you have to compile them by yourself (a documentation to help you will be made).  
We don't provide any prebuilt binaries that could be used along with a config file to respect our philosophy of one standalone executable that contains everything.
